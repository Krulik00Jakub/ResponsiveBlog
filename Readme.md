# Responsive Blog:
This is an example of a website written using `java/jakarta server pages` technology.
The backend content management is implemented using a `file-based java` system.
I plan on migrating the file-based paradigm to a `SQL-based database` in the near future.

This webpage was tested using Apache Tomcat with the Eclipse IDE.

A preview of the final product can be viewed by running  [`scrolling.jsp`](ResponsiveBlog/main/src/main/webapp/scrolling.jsp)

**NOTE** - In progress
