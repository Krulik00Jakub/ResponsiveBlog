Character: 五; wu3 / ng5

This character, being the last character of the week, represents the meaning 'five'. This character is categorized under the radical 2F06_⼆ (top horizontal stroke, bottom horizontal stroke). The presence
of the radical 2F06_⼆ does not have to do with the meaning of the character. Unlike with the previous character, 四, there is no explanation behind the evolution of the ideograph 4E94_五. Although historians and archeologists were not able to devise an explanation behind the form of the word 五, there are still historical manuscripts which contain the character 五 in its archaic forms.

The character 五 used to have the form 20121_𠄡. This was during the time periods of oracle bone script during the Shang Dynasty (18th-12th century BC) all through to the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). There is no formal explanation, or archeological evidence that specifies the reasoning behind the form: 20121_𠄡, however; some scholars hypothesised that the glyph originated based off of old Chinese hand gestures for numbers. Another hypothesis that historians have posed is that the 20121_𠄡 could
have been a phonetic loan word. This meaning that 20121_𠄡 had the same pronunciation as the word for 'five', and they started to use this character to represent the number five. The Dictionary of Pictographs
(象形字典) states that the meaning of the word 20121_𠄡 is:  crossing/meeting (between two extremes, the sky and the earth)" [9].

Like with most Chinese glyphs, the character 五 has its own story. One that archeologists worked hard to uncover. From scouring ancient bone carvings to bamboo tablets and characters painted on silk scrolls,
the evanescent history of Chinese writing is slowly unveiled. In conclusion, the origin of the character 五 can only be pondered and hypothesised upon. While there are a couple of well formulated theories, we have yet to learn the correct answer about how 五 came to be the numeral five.
